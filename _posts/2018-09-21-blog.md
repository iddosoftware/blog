title: Aestethic Disclaimer and Concerns Regarding Privacy

At the current time, the website on which this blog has been built by the only active employee of Iddo Software, namely the author of this post (to which we will, henceforth, simply refer to as _me_), who is not really a designer or web developer. He's, arguably, pretty good at other stuff, like machine learning and computer vision, but you'll have to bear with us the burden of his lack of talent when it comes to making web pages look nice.

So, I'm trying to make the case that, on the off chance you'll find anything that helps you here, please don't let the sheer ugliness of the website stop you from using and, maybe, even enjoying it. Perhaps some day we'll afford hiring a good designer to make the experience of reading the stuff here less painful, but until then, we'll just drop here whatever we think would soften the pain of existence as a machine learning engineer and hope for the best.

## Blog building tech and privacy concerns
The blog is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and statically built from [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Minimal theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/) made available by GitHub Pages. You can find the source code of the posts on the public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iddosoftware/blog) from which it is automatically published.

At this time, we're not interested in serving advertisments of any kind or even measuring how many people visit our page, so, as you can see in the public source code of our blog we don't use anything like Google Analytics, or keep any logs ourselves. But you should probably be aware that you're going through Microsoft's servers when getting our content, and that you've probably gotten to us with some help from [ClouDNS](https://www.cloudns.net/).
