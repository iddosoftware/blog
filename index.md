This is the place where our developers rant on the wonders met during their technical and scientific endeavours of satisfying our customers' desires. As some of these customers were, thankfully, gracious enough to allow us to publish our findings, we're able to share them here.

As, for the moment, the only employee of the company (and also its CEO, CTO, janitor etc.) is its founder, namely Bogdan Budescu, check out his [personal blog](https://bbudescu.github.io). Techincal posts will be added here when it will make more sense (e.g., when there will be at least another collaborator).
